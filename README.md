## MacType Update
Don't forget to update mactype dll files after installing last version. Latest changes are available in MacType issues:
* [MacType64.dll](https://github.com/snowie2000/mactype/issues/488#issuecomment-714879581)

**Please consider that you need to copy these files into MacType installation folder ( after temporary disabling service )**

## Known Issue
Current font we used ( MacOS Font ) doesn't respect windows font system. Accordingly may you face an **Square glyph** for some characters of non-english texts. Unfortunately i deal with it for :iran: FARSI language. *Workarounds is being welcomed* :heart:
